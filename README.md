## Fullstack MERN Project - Book Store

Create and Modify a list of books using Javascript

### Features:

Created project using Javascript.\
Frontend technologies:
* Used JSX along with React to create functional Web pages
* Used Tailwind CSS to format the Web Page's components

Backend technologies:
* Written in Javascript via node.js
* Used Express and MongoDB to define backend components
* Store data in a mongo database

### Steps to Run:

1. Log into MongoDB and create a cluster. Get the Mongodb url connection string of this cluster and save it in config.js in the backend folder

2. Open a terminal in the bookstore project directory. Do "cd backend" then "npm run dev". This will start the server and link the backend to mongoDB 

3. Open another terminal in the bookstore project directory. Do "cd frontend" then "npm run dev". This will start the web app 

4. In the frontend terminal, click on the link in the terminal to launch the web app

### Using the App:

The project will introduce you with a table screen which allows you to create a new book using the plus symbol. To create a book you must add a title, author, and publish year.

Next to each element in the table you will see the first showbook option which gives details about the entry.

The second edit symbol stores the original values on the screen and allows you to change those values in the database

The third symbol allows you to delete books out of the database

There are two options at the top which shows table view or card view. Card view gives the option to view bigger details bout the respective book.
